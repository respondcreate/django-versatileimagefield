- Added support for Django 1.10.x and djangorestframework 3.5.x.
- Fixed a bug that caused :ref:`delete_all_created_images() <deleting-multiple-renditions>` to fail on field instances that didn't have filtered, sized & filtered+sized images. 

1.6
^^^
- Fixed a bug that prevented sized images from deleting properly when the field they were associated with was using a custom ``upload_to`` function. If you are using a custom ``SizedImage`` subclass on your project then be sure to check out :ref:`this section <ensuring-sized-images-deleted>` in the docs. (Thanks, `@Mortal <https://github.com/Mortal>`_!)

1.5
^^^
- Fixed a bug that was causing placeholder images to serialize incorrectly with ``VersatileImageFieldSerializer`` (thanks, `@romanosipenko <https://github.com/romanosipenko>`_!).
- Ensured embedded ICC profiles are preserved when creating new images (thanks, `@gbts <https://github.com/gbts>`_!).
- Added support for `progressive JPEGs <https://optimus.io/support/progressive-jpeg/>`_ (more info :ref:`here <versatileimagefield-settings>`).

1.4
^^^
- Included JPEG resize quality to sized image keys.
- Added ``VERSATILEIMAGEFIELD_SETTINGS['image_key_post_processor']`` setting for specifying a function that will post-process sized image keys to create simpler/cleaner filenames. ``django-versatileimagefield`` ships with two built-in post processors: ``'versatileimagefield.processors.md5'`` and ``'versatileimagefield.processors.md5_16'`` (more info :ref:`here <versatileimagefield-settings>`).

1.3
^^^
- Added the ability to delete images & cache entries created by a ``VersatileImageField`` both :ref:`individually <deleting-individual-renditions>` and :ref:`in bulk <deleting-multiple-renditions>`. Relevant docs :doc:`here </deleting_created_images>`.

1.2.2
^^^^^
- Fixed a critical bug that broke initial project setup (i.e. when ``django.setup()`` is run) when an `app config <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/ref/applications/>`_ path was included in ``INSTALLED_APPS`` (as opposed to a 'vanilla' python module).

1.2.1
^^^^^
- Fixed a bug that caused ``collectstatic`` to fail when using placeholder images with external storage, like Amazon S3 (thanks, `@jelko <https://github.com/jelko>`_!).
- ``VersatileImageField`` now returns its placeholder URL if ``.url`` is accessed directly (previously only placeholder images were returned if a sizer or filter was accessed). Thanks (again), `@jelko <https://github.com/jelko>`_!

1.2
^^^
- Fixed a bug that caused ``collectstatic`` to fail when using ``ManifestStaticFilesStorage`` (thanks, `@theskumar <https://github.com/theskumar>`_!).
- Dropped support for Python 3.3.x.
- Added support for Django 1.9.x.

1.1
^^^
- Re-added support for Django 1.5.x (by request, support for Django 1.5.x was previously dropped in the 0.4 release). If you're using ``django-versatileimagefield`` on a Django 1.5.x project please be sure to read :ref:`this bit of documentation <django-15-admin-note>`.
- Added support for Django REST Framework 3.3.x.

1.0.6
^^^^^
- Updated ``VersatileImageFieldSerializer`` to serve image URLs as absolute URIs (if its associated field's storage class isn't doing so already).

  - Now: http://localhost:8000/media/headshots/jane_doe_headshot.jpg

1.0.5
^^^^^
- Fixed image preview on form validation errors (thanks, `@securedirective <https://github.com/securedirective>`_!).

- Simplified requirements installation (which makes django-versatileimagefield installable by ``pip<=1.6``)
